### 2.3.1 Absorption

As amikacin was administered only intravenously, absorption did not play a role in the PK of amikacin. 

### 2.3.2 Distribution

Amikacin is a renally cleared antibiotic with relatively low distribution volume (approximately 0.25 –0.50 L/kg in adults) ([Lanao 1982](#5-references)). 

As the FDA ([FDA Label](#5-references)) and the US national library of medicine ([DailyMed](#5-references))  report a serum protein binding ≤ 10% and range from 0 to 11% respectively,  Claassen et al. ([Claassen 2015](#5-references)) have applied a fraction unbound of 1 in the reported amikacin PBPK model.

The PK-Sim standard organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods that are built in PK-Sim were applied to evaluate the observed clinical data. Specific organ permeability normalized to surface area was automatically calculated by PK-Sim.

### 2.3.3 Metabolism and Elimination

Amikacin is eliminated by the kidneys without metabolism. In adults with normal renal function, 94-98% of a single IM or IV dose of amikacin is excreted unchanged by glomerular filtration in the kidney within 24 hours. ([DailyMed](#5-references))
