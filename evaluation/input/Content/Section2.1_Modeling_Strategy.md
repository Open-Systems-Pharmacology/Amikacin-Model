The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#-references)). Relevant information on anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-references)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim速 and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim速 are described in the publicly available PK-Sim速 Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([Schlender 2016](#5 -references)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

The Amikacin model was evaluated in its performance in adults using data of the following  publication:

- Walker JM, Wise R, Mitchard M. The pharmacokinetics of amikacin and gentamicin in volunteers: a comparison of individual differences. J Antimicrob Chemother. 1979 Jan;5(1):95-9.
  (https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/5/1/95/747852)

As the PBPK of Amikacin has been previously developed, this model was rebuild, without any further parameter identification using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim速. 

Simulations using this PBPK model were compared to the reported data to evaluate model appropriateness and to assess model qualification, by means of diagnostics plots and predicted versus observed concentration-time profiles, of which the results support an adequate prediction of the PK in adults.

During model building, uncertainties in data quality, as well as study differences may cause not being able to adequately describe the PK of all reported clinical studies.
